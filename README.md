# Rubber Band Habits

Rubber Band Habits is a habit-tracking iOS app I built in SwiftUI. Made in October 2024 and put on the App Store shortly thereafter. 

## Why I Built It
I wanted to challenge myself to build something that feels like a native iOS app. I analyzed Apple’s Translate app for its simplicity and borrowed that design mindset.
Updating the app has also been a fun learning experience. Some parts were solid and only needed small tweaks while other parts were pure duct tape from earlier panic coding. Refactoring it has taught me what “well-made code” actually feels like and how it will be viewed by posterity. Most importantly, I enjoyed making it. 

## Features
- Create habits and track completions over time
- Support for “good” and “bad” habits to set goals or limits
- Daily / weekly / monthly goal tracking
- Progress view and habit detail screens

## Tech
- SwiftUI
- Local persistence with SwiftData (upgraded from UserDefaults)
- One source of truth underpins the whole app with the new storage system

## For Developers Interested
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode
3. Select an iOS simulator
4. Build & Run

## App Store
Available on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rubber-band-habits/id6738013644

## Status
The app is actively maintained. I’m continuing to improve structure, performance, and UI polish.

If you try it out, I’d appreciate feedback.
